# Pyglet Chain Reaction!!!
A multiplayer tile clicking game.
Made by: Joshua, Aldreana and Loren

Hi!
Welcome to our version of Chain Reaction. Now you can play our **exciting new twist** on the classic mobile game.
This was coded in Python, using the **Pyglet module.**

Choose from 6 Parody characters! The Red Mr. Lobsters, Orange Dalandaniel, Yellow SpongeFred, Green Green, Blue Kuyaneo, and Purple Borney the Dragon!

## Where Do I Try It?
Download the files as a .zip, extract, and run main.py
Make sure you have pyglet installed first! This is the graphics engine we used.
